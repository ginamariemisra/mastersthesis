Read Me File for Chapter 4

Description of Files

R Code
------

1. Analysis1c.R
This file is called Analysis 1c because there were preliminary experiments 1a and 1b where the methods were tested. No R code was generated for those experiments. This file includes statisticaly analysis and plotting for Salmonella and Listeria, and the Between Pathogens tests.

Raw Data
--------

1. sunflower2.csv
This file is called sunflower2.csv because the first sunflower.csv had errors in it, yet I wanted to keep them separate. This contains all of the raw data resulting from the plate counts at initial and harvest.
